      Hint: Description
      Value: " strike on April 2018 in Karunya was greatly, for the unjust fee hike and the formation of an Independent Student's Council. The protest was peaceful for most of the time, but several isolated events leading to violence did n during the protest. The students damaged the gates of Department of Civil and Mech and barged inside the Science and Humanities Block, cutting down the warnings of the faculties trying to stop them.  The strike visibly saw the First and Second year students coming together in one unison. In further analysis, we know that the D Day was well planned with the circulation of a 10 Point demand in whatsapp groups and a call for a peaceful strike day anytime in the coming days. Even snacks was given during the sitout outside the admin block.(Some guys just went at that time to get snacks ! LOL) Trust me no one expected the protest to takeoff so high, just by the combo of first and second years. Students from the senior classes though very less in number, may have participated in the strike."
