      Hint: Description
      Value: "In November 2017, Karunya Institute of Technology was ordered to close two off-campus centres in Periyanaickenpalayam and Lakshmi Mills which were opened without permission. In addition, a letter from the UGC showed that Karunya has not renewed its deemed-to-be-university status, which expired in 2007.[9] The institute has agreed to close the centres, leaving 750 students to find other solutions, since the courses they were pursuing (management, science and social science) are not offered at Karunya's main campus. The UGC had also formed a committee of experts to inspect the institution.[10] Acting on the recommendations of said committee, in June 2018 an extension to the deemed-to-be-university status was granted for a period of five years."
