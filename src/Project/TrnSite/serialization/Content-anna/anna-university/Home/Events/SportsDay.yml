      Value: To educationist H.C.Buck, “A properly directed physical education programme should result in health, happiness, efficiency and character.” Aiming in developing the whole human being by exercising the whole human body, the physical training wing of the school tries its level best, to train the students within the limitations. As the colourful opening & closing ceremonies flavoured with the kindled sports torch remains etched in the mind of any sports lover, our young athletes truly reveal their sporting spirit during the annual sports week.
