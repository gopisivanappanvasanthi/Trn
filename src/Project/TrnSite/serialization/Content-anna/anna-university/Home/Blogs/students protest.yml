The management has urged the students to approach their college principals and seek details of the regulation. (Photo Courtesy: The News Minute) Students of engineering colleges affiliated to Anna University have launched a statewide protest against a regulation issued in 2017. The university implemented the choice-based credit system (CBCS), under which the students who fail in a paper in a semester can reappear only in the next year along with their juniors in that semester.  The students are protesting against this rule. Anna University Registrar J Kumar, who met the students and later the reporters, said the university had received the students' written demands. However, any changes in the regulations can be made only after a committee studies the demands."
